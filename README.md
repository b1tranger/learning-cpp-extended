# learning-cpp-extended
Learning about what comes after CLI programming in C/C++

### # purpose
- OpenGL | OpenGL is fundamentally a C API, meaning its functions can be called directly from a C program. | [Related Repo](https://github.com/b1tranger/learning-gui-client)
- Arduino | Arduino programming involves writing "sketches" in a simplified C/C++ based language using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and uploading them to an Arduino board to control electronic components. The language is designed to be easy for beginners to learn.
- Game Dev
  - Godot with C++ &larr; [J.E.N.O.V.A](https://github.com/Jenova-Framework/J.E.N.O.V.A) | Projekt J.E.N.O.V.A is a comprehensive series of components for the Godot Engine expanding its capabilities with cutting-edge technologies. It introduces fully-featured C++ scripting within the Godot Editor and allows the use of modern C++ 20/23 standards within the Godot Engine, similar to GDScript/C# | [Related Repo](https://github.com/b1tranger/Game-Development-Journey)
  - (future) Game Engine Dev | Learn about Shaders (GLSL/HLSL), collision detection, and scene graphs.
  - (future) SFML or SDL2 for windowing and input handling, as they are the industry standard for C++ multimedia.
- (future) Linux Embedded | Learn how to write C drivers for a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone. | [Related Repo](https://github.com/b1tranger/learning-linux)
- (future) Networking | Use C Sockets or Boost.Asio to build a custom web server or a peer-to-peer chat app.
